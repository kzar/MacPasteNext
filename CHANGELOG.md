## [Unreleased]

- Changed

- The PRIMARY selection now lives in the system-wide `Selection` named pasteboard instead of a buffer inside MacPasteNext. `Selection` is the name GNU Emacs's Cocoa port uses for its own PRIMARY emulation, so MacPasteNext and Emacs now share one selection: with `select-enable-primary` set, `C-y` in Emacs yanks text you highlighted anywhere on the system, and an Emacs region (mouse or keyboard) pastes on middle-click in any app.
- MacPasteNext now keeps out of the way of apps that maintain PRIMARY themselves, currently GNU Emacs. Selections made in Emacs are no longer captured, because Emacs publishes its own region via `select-active-regions` and our synthesized `Cmd+C` is `kill-ring-save` there - which deactivated the region you had just made and added a kill-ring entry. Middle-clicks in Emacs are no longer intercepted either, because Emacs binds `mouse-2` to `mouse-yank-primary`, which inserts PRIMARY at the click position - more precisely than MacPasteNext can, since Emacs exposes no accessibility tree for its buffer. MacPasteNext still brings the clicked Emacs window to the front, since a middle-click does not activate a window on macOS.
- PRIMARY survives a MacPasteNext restart, because the macOS pasteboard server holds it rather than the app.
- Any process in your login session can now read *or set* PRIMARY - the same trust model as the regular `Cmd+C` clipboard. Middle-click therefore pastes whatever holds the selection now, not necessarily MacPasteNext's last capture.
- Middle-click paste no longer requires MacPasteNext to have captured something first, so it also works with *Auto-Copy on Selection* turned off.

- Known limitations

- Middle-click paste into Emacs inserts at point rather than at the click position, because MacPasteNext swallows the middle-click before Emacs's own `mouse-yank-primary` can see it.

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-06-05

- Fixed

- Auto-update from `v1.0.0-beta.5` was sometimes reported as "you're up to date" even though `v1.0.0` was published. Root cause: the appcast generator stripped the `v` prefix from `<sparkle:version>` while `CFBundleVersion` in the installed bundle still carried it (`v1.0.0-beta.5` vs `1.0.0`). Sparkle's `SUStandardVersionComparator` tokenises by digit/non-digit boundaries and falls back to a heuristic when one side leads with a letter and the other with a digit, which produced unreliable "newer?" decisions on already-installed clients. `scripts/sparkle-publish-update.sh` now keeps the `v` prefix verbatim so every appcast entry matches the bundle format (`v1.0.X`).
- Backfilled the existing `v1.0.0` appcast on GitHub with the corrected format so installs that managed to reach the v-prefixed feed can finally see `v1.0.0` (and now `v1.0.1`) as newer than `v1.0.0-beta.5`.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-06-05

First stable release. Distilled from the `v1.0.0-beta.{1..5}` series.

- Highlights

- Linux-style PRIMARY selection on macOS. Selecting text with the mouse (drag, double-click, triple-click) captures it into a private PRIMARY buffer that is independent from the `Cmd+C` clipboard; middle-click pastes the buffer wherever the cursor is.
- Active event interception via `CGEventTap` so MacPasteNext can swallow side-button / middle-click events instead of letting the OS or focused app react on top of our action (fixes Terminal.app double-paste, [#1](https://github.com/d0dg3r/MacPasteNext/issues/1)).
- Optional microphone mute on a configurable side button, with a visible Red/Green indicator in the menu bar.
- Built-in Sparkle 2 auto-updater. The app polls `https://github.com/d0dg3r/MacPasteNext/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`, verifies every update ZIP with EdDSA, and installs in-place. Background checks are user-toggleable.
- Bilingual UI (English / Deutsch) with tooltips on every setting, an integrated debug console, and a one-click `tccutil reset` for stuck Accessibility prompts.

- Release infrastructure

- Self-signed release pipeline that produces a reproducible, identifier-stable `MacPasteNext-macos-arm64.zip` and a Sparkle-signed `appcast.xml` for every tag.
- All releases (including `-beta.N` channels) publish as non-prerelease GitHub releases and are promoted to `latest`, so the Sparkle feed URL always resolves.
- `scripts/sparkle-bootstrap.sh` for the one-time EdDSA keypair generation, `scripts/sparkle-publish-update.sh` for CI-side signing and appcast generation, and a smoke test that verifies framework embedding, Info.plist keys, and codesign on every build.

## [v1.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-06-04

- Added

- New "Updates" section in the settings panel with a toggle to enable or disable Sparkle's background update checks. The previously menu-only "Check for Updates..." action is now also available as a button next to the toggle.
- Tooltips on every settings toggle and picker (auto-copy, middle-click paste, mic mute, mouse-button picker, language, log console). Hover over an option to learn what it does.
- About dialog now shows the configured Sparkle update feed URL so users can verify which channel they are pulling updates from.
- PRIMARY capture log entries include a short, sanitized preview of the captured text (newlines / tabs rendered as visible markers, truncated at 30 chars) instead of just the length.

- Changed

- `MacPasteAppDelegate.applyAutoUpdatePreference()` keeps `SPUUpdater.automaticallyChecksForUpdates` in sync with the new `autoUpdateEnabled` setting on launch and whenever the user flips the toggle.

- Internal

- Removed `@Published` from properties on `MacPasteAppDelegate`, which is not an `ObservableObject`; the annotations were no-ops and just added noise to the API surface.

## [v1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-06-04

- Added

- Sparkle 2 in-app auto-updater. The app now embeds `Sparkle.framework`, exposes a "Check for Updates..." menu item, and polls `https://github.com/d0dg3r/MacPasteNext/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml` for new releases. Every update ZIP is signed with EdDSA and verified before installation, replacing the manual download/`xattr`/unzip dance.
- New `scripts/sparkle-bootstrap.sh` for the one-time EdDSA keypair generation, and `scripts/sparkle-publish-update.sh` for CI-side `sign_update` + appcast generation.

- Fixed

- `EventHandler.stop()` now invalidates both the `CFMachPort` and its `CFRunLoopSource` in addition to removing the source, preventing leaks when the event tap is toggled repeatedly.
- Auto-copy capture no longer clobbers an external clipboard write: the change count captured right after reading the selection is compared against the current change count, and the pre-capture pasteboard snapshot is only restored if nothing else wrote to the clipboard in the meantime.
- Middle-click paste applies the same guard: the change count snapshotted right after writing `primaryBuffer` is compared before the post-paste restore, so a user `Cmd+C` (or another app's clipboard write) during the paste window is preserved.

## [v1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-04

- Fixed

- Double-click word selection (and triple-click line selection) is now captured into the PRIMARY buffer reliably. The click state is tracked from `leftMouseDown` (more reliable than from the up event), and the Cmd+C is delayed by 50 ms so the host app has time to finalize the selection.
- Triple-click no longer loses to a stale double-click capture: multi-click captures bypass the auto-copy debounce, and a generation counter cancels superseded captures so the most recent click wins.

## [v1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-04

- Fixed

- Side mouse buttons (4/5) no longer double-trigger: the EventHandler now uses an active `CGEventTap` instead of a passive `NSEvent` global monitor, so the configured mic-mute button is fully intercepted (no more browser Back/Forward firing alongside the mic toggle).
- Middle-click paste no longer mis-fires on the thumb-back button: paste is restricted to the true middle button (`buttonNumber == 2`) instead of the previous `2 || 3` check.
- No more double-paste in apps with their own middle-click paste (Terminal.app with the middle-click paste preference enabled, X11-aware apps): the middle-click event is now swallowed when `middleClickPaste` is active, so only our paste fires (resolves #1).

- Added

- Linux-style PRIMARY selection: selections are stored in an internal `primaryBuffer` while the system pasteboard is snapshotted and restored, so the regular `Cmd+C` clipboard is preserved across auto-copy events. Middle-click pastes from `primaryBuffer` and restores the prior clipboard afterwards.

- Changed

- Double-/triple-click detection switched from a manual time threshold to `CGEventField.mouseEventClickState`, matching the OS click classifier.
- Heavy work (clipboard change-count polling, AppleScript mic toggle, paste restore) is dispatched off the tap callback to avoid macOS disabling the tap for running too long.

## [v1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-03-12

- Added

- Robust settings reopen lifecycle handling to avoid intermittent reopen crashes.
- Context-aware permission panel visibility in settings (shown only when needed).
- Status bar icon fallback for `Mic Feature Off` so menu access remains visible.

- Changed

- New release policy: beta tags (`v1.0.0-beta.N`) publish as pre-releases.
- Post-release screenshot automation now runs automatically after successful release workflow completion.
- Settings UI now hides `Simulate Copy/Paste` when debug logs are disabled.
- Settings window sizing now stays compact without logs and expands dynamically when logs are enabled.
- About/settings copy and support metadata links were polished.

- Fixed

- Self-signed CI guard now verifies certificate presence robustly on macOS runners.
